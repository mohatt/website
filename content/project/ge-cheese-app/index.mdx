#### About the client

Glen Echo Fine Foods Inc. distributes a large selection of fine food products with an emphasis on cheese and related products for both
retail and food service. They carry over 400 different cheeses in stock and can deliver even more.

#### Project Description

Responsive web app, custom-built to run on iPad and iPod Touch devices displayed in supermarkets throughout Canada and set up as interactive kiosks. Users are able to interact with the
app in order to learn more about featured cheeses and sign up for the Glen Echo newsletter for future updates.

I was the lead developer of the project, working alongside two other team members. My main responsibilities were:
- Turning the designs mockups and UX flows provided by our designer into a fully functional/responsive web app based on Symfony framework.
- Building a simple recommendation engine that uses user input to present a list of the most recommended types of cheese, it is also used to display a list of related products on every cheese page.
- Development of an admin dashboard that allows managing the cheese database and other app configurations.
- Implementation of CI/CD pipelines.
