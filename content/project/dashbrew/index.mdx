#### Project Description

Powerful, cross-platform PHP development environment that can be used as a replacement for local development stacks such as MAMP, XAMPP, and
others. It provides an easy way to manage, organize and develop PHP projects and comes with a **unique dashboard** that allows managing
various environment aspects. It also comes preinstalled with [all software and tools](https://github.com/mdkholy/dashbrew-basebox#included-software)
needed to start developing right out of the box.

Dashbrew is based on [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and uses [PHPBrew](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew) -- the PHP version
management tool, to allow developing both web and command-line projects on different PHP versions and configurations using the same machine.
