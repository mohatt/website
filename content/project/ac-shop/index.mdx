#### About the client

Alabama Chanin is a lifestyle company producing well-designed and thoughtfully made goods for the person and the home.

#### Project Description

Headless web application for a heavily trafficed e-commerce webstore built with Next.js, React and Shopify GraphQL API.

The checkout is facilitated using the Shopify checkout flow, and the cart fulfillment up to the point of purchase is handled
in the web app.

The application development included building out an infrastructure pipeline using Ansible on AWS, and the website
is served using Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer. All the hosting infrastructure was built using Terraform.
