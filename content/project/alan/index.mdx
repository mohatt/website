#### About the client

Alan Agency is a publishing and content marketing agency based in London and mostly known for their special reports in The Times and
The Sunday Times. I developed their Agency website with a cutting-edge technology stack. The technology used is WordPress as a headless
CMS with GatsbyJS as a front end and GraphQL for the data layer.

#### Project Description

Coming soon.
