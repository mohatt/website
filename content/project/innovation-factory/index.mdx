#### About the client

Innovation Factory is the supplier of PITÂ® (Power Ideas Together), the innovation software that is used globally by leading companies to
support innovation. PIT enables companies to gather, share, enrich and develop ideas and is used
by a broad range of clients such as Heineken, Vodafone, PostNL and Strukton Rail.

#### Project Description

My primary role in the project was to turn the design mockups and UX flows provided by the client into a fully functional/responsive Wordpress site.
I converted the designs into a HTML/CSS/JS version then implemented it into a Wordpress theme based on Genesis Framework.

I also developed a custom plugin that extends Wordpress admin dashboard to allow site admins easily
manage content, that includes blog articles, slideshow images, their partners, clients,
team members, contacts and some custom designed pages with in-page navigation and parallax effects.

The final phase of the project involved building a custom newsletter email template for Mailchimp that matches the new website look and feel.
