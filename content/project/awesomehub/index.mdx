#### Project Description

Responsive web app built with Angular, NgRx and Material Design.

The App was originally built for educational purposes and to experiment with Angular 2, NgRx and RxJS, but I have recently managed
to update the codebase to Angular 12.

The App UI is built on top of the good old Material Design Lite library, It's much lighter than Angular Material, but I originally
used it because Angular Material was still in alpha at the time I built this app.

Check project repository on Github for more info.
