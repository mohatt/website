#### About the client

The Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) is one of the largest consumer-based organizations in Canada. They help provide freedom
and peace of mind to 6 million Members through 9 automobile Clubs and over 140 offices located across the country.

#### Project Description

The purpose of the Teen Eco Drive Video contest is to encourage teens to share their Eco Driving Pledge in a creative way, utilizing
the mini video platforms, Instagram and Vine. Participation in the contest is done by creating a mini video on Instagram or Vine
then sharing it using the contest hashtag (eg. #CAAEcoDrive).

I was the lead developer of the project responsible for the development of the contest system backend as well as the
frontend. The backend was built using Symfony framework, Instagram, Vine and Twitter REST APIs. The frontend was built
using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery based on the design mockups I received from our web designer.

The contest system consisted of different microservices, one of them is the video collection microservice which continuously searches the mentioned video platforms for videos matching the
contest hashtag and stores them from further processing and approval. Once a video is approved, it is displayed on the contest homepage
and the author is notified via an auto-generated comment on his video post.

Once the contest is over, the admin selects 3 winning videos based on different factors, amongst them is the number of user votes per video.
